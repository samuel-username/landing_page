## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I became more familiar with Bootstrap classes and responsive design
```html
<div class="container-md container-sm-fluid">
  <h1 class="display-1">Hey there</h1>
</div>
```

### Continued development

I want to continue with Bootstrap from now on, and get good at using it.
